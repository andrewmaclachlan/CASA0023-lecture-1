# Remote Sensing Physics Laws 1

* Planck's law: Electromagnetic radiation emitted from a black body (**theoretical** concept, absorbs and emits all energy upon it) at a wavelength as function of absolute temperature
  * Every object emits radiation at all times and at all wavelengths
  * Energy at shorter wavelengths increases rapidly with temperature
  * Longer wavelengths have less energy

# Remote Sensing Physics Laws 2

* Stefan-Boltzmann law: total electromagnetic radiation emitted by a blackbody as a function of the absolute temperature which corresponds to the area under the radiation curve (integral). 
  * all processes that generate radiation are related to temperature of the body emitting it
  * higher the temperature the more radiation it emits.

# Remote Sensing Physics Laws 3

  
* Wien's Displacement law: wavelength at which maximum spectral radiant exitance occurs 
   * as temperature increase energy emitted rises and wavelength with most energy becomes shorter
